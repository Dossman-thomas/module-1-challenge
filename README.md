# Horiseon Website Code Refactor

## Description

Horiseon website code refactoring that follows accessibility standards and optimizes for search engines (SEO).

Prior to refactoring, the website's codebase lacked:

 - a concise title
 - semantic HTML elements
 - proper HTML structure
 - alt attributes
 - proper working links
 - descriptive comments

 Adding these elements to the Horiseon website increases the accessibility for both the browser, users, and developers alike. This will help the company's searchability and ability to attract new clients.
